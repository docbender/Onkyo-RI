# Onkyo-RI
Control Onkyo devices through Remote Interactive port

## Connection
To connect to the RI port is used 3.5mm mono jack. Data are sent via TTL logic.

## Protocol
Protocol description could be found at:
*    http://lirc.sourceforge.net/remotes/onkyo/Remote_Interactive

or with grafical representation at:
*    http://fredboboss.free.fr/articles/onkyo_ri.php .

Protocol is pretty simple for implementation. In one message is transfered 12 bit code. This code represents action for target device. Most significant bit is send first.

## RI codes
At mentioned sites are also listed codes for Onkyo devices. Unfortunnately none of the codes is not valid for my receiver TX-8020. To determine the valid codes I wrote a simple loop for Arduino that goes through the whole 12bit range of codes (0x0-0xFFF). Results are listed below commands.
