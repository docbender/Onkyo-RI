# Onkyo-RI
Control Onkyo devices is possible among others through Remote Interactive port. This port is normally used for direct communication between two Onkyo devices (ex. receiver and CD player). But why not turn on the receiver automatically when you start your own player?

## Connection
To connect to the RI port is used 3.5mm mono jack. Data are sent via TTL logic.

## Protocol
Protocol description could be found at:
*    http://lirc.sourceforge.net/remotes/onkyo/Remote_Interactive

or with grafical representation at:
*    http://fredboboss.free.fr/articles/onkyo_ri.php .

Protocol is pretty simple for implementation. In one message is transfered 12 bit code. This code represents action for target device. Most significant bit is send first.

## RI codes
At mentioned sites are also listed codes for Onkyo devices. Unfortunnately none of the codes is not valid for my receiver TX-8020. To determine the valid codes I wrote a simple loop for Arduino (more below) that goes through the whole 12bit code range (0x0-0xFFF). Results are listed below commands.

### RI codes - receiver 
Codes are valid for TX-8020 receiver. With a high probability it will work with other Onkyo receivers.

##Test program
Program is located in repo folder Onkyo_test. It serves for check all codes (0x0 - 0xFFF) on target device in 500ms interval. For data line pin 10 is used as default. 

Actual checked code is sent as ASCII through serial port and can be displayed in terminal. For serial port 9600b/s is set.  Using terminal test program can be stopped, reset or user defined code could be used. 

Terminal commands:
* p - pause/run command sending
* r - reset loop (program start from 0)
* hexadecimal number - number in hexadecimal format represents code that user want to test on target device. From this code automatical procedure will continue.
